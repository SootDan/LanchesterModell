# Lanchester's Model for Battle
## Lanchester's Laws
Lanchester's Laws provide a mathematical framework for predicting the outcome of a singular battle. These laws only apply in battles since the First World War. In the ancient times, a soldier could only engage one other soldier. However, thanks to advancements in rifling and tactics, it is now possible for a soldier to engage multiple enemies at once.  
With Lanchester's Laws, one may pre-determine the outcome of a fight if given the numbers and firepower of the respective armies. It is assumed that each soldier has access to an infinite amount of bullets as long as they are alive.  

## Programming
The project was developed with Java 23. No further packages than the standard Java library are needed.  
The mathematical formulas are derviced from a simplified version of Lanchester's Laws; they are stored within the MathManager class.
